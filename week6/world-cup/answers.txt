Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: The prediction that the time taken for 100,000 simulations would be exactly double that of 10,000 simulations proved incorrect.
It was slightly slower.
Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: The point at which the predictions become "good enough" may vary from one situation to another.
I would choose a number of simulations that provides a good trade-off between accuracy and cost
