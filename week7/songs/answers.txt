# If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
I would characterize the as follows:
1) Diverse Taste: If the listener's playlist includes a wide variety of genres and artists,
    it suggests they have a diverse taste in music. They may enjoy exploring different musical styles and moods.

2) Emotional Range: The emotional range of the songs can also give you an idea of the listener's emotional depth. For example,
    if their playlist includes both upbeat and energetic songs as well as slower,more melancholic tunes, they may have a broad emotional spectrum.

3) Lyrics vs. Instrumentals: The ratio of songs with lyrics to instrumental tracks can indicate whether the listener values lyrics
    and storytelling in music or prefers purely instrumental compositions.

 # Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
    . Long-Term Listening History: Analyze the listener's complete listening history, spanning several years or even decades,
         if available. This would provide a more comprehensive view of their musical journey and evolving tastes.
